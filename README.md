# What's this about?
The Endstar SDK allows you to use Unity to create custom props and terrain for use in [Endstar](https://endlessstudios.com/games/Endstar).

After creating the terrain or props you can export them to the cloud and then use them in Endstar. You can even share them with others.

## Getting Started
While there a number of ways to install the Endstar SDK, we highly recommend the [Guided installation](#Guided-installation) section.

No matter how you install it, utilizing Unity 2022.3.28f1 is required, and you need to install the following modules: Android Build Support, iOS Build Support, Linux Build Support (Mono), Mac Build Support (Mono) and Windows Build Support (IL2PCC).

### Guided installation
Follow the guide under the [Making Terrain](#Making-Terrain) for a guided installation. The SDK handles both terrain and prop creation. We're working on transitioning away from the PDF and into a guide here!

### Manual project installation
Download the SDK starter project directly [here](https://endless-launcher.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/EndstarSDK/Endstar-SDK.zip).

### Existing project package installation
You can add this package directly to a Unity project by adding this git URL via Unity's Package Manager: [https://github.com/Endless-Studios/Endstar-SDK-Package/](https://github.com/Endless-Studios/Endstar-SDK-Package.git)

After exporting a prop to Endstar, you can use the in game tools to write custom Lua code to create new behaviors!
